# tumblr4s

A simple and (hopefully) idiomatic Scala library for the [Tumblr API](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2). Provides all API functionality in native Scala code and objects (no json responses). See [this post](http://orrsella.com/2012/12/10/introducing-tumblr4s-a-scala-library-for-the-tumblr-api/) for some more background.

## Latest Version

The latest version of tumblr4s is 1.0.3. To add it to your project using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), add the following to your build.sbt file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.orrsella" %% "tumblr4s" % "1.0.3"
```

## Dependencies

The library is published for Scala 2.10 and 2.11 (version 1.0.1 still supports Scala 2.9, in case you're interested).

The following dependencies are used:

* [Dispatch 0.8.10 ("dispatch-classic")](http://dispatch-classic.databinder.net/Dispatch.html) for making HTTP requests (http, oauth and mime modules)

* [json4s 3.2.11](http://json4s.org/) for json parsing (essentially "lift-json but outside of the lift project")

## Usage

### Authentication

Working with the Tumblr API requires an API key (which is identical to the OAuth Consumer Key). If you don't have one go [register an application](http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps). "API key" authenticated methods only require the API key, while "OAuth" authenticated methods also require the Secret Key and a user's access token key and access token secret (see [the Authentication section](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#auth) for more details.)

The `TumblrApi` class encapsulates all functionality found in the API. Construct it using the companion object:

```scala
import com.orrsella.tumblr4s._

val tumblr = TumblrApi(apiKey) // without OAuth capabilities
```

or

```scala
val tumblr = TumblrApi(apiKey, apiSecret, accessTokenKey, accessTokenSecret) // with OAuth capabilities
```

If you'll try to use an OAuth required method without the credentials supplied (first example), you'll get a `TumblrApiOAuthException`.

### Querying

All methods mirror the available [API functionality](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2) and have similar names. Here are some examples, with partial parameters (many more are available):

```scala
import com.orrsella.tumblr4s.model._

try {
  val baseHostname = "staff.tumblr.com" // a standard or custom blog hostname, see:
                                        // http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#hostname
  val blog: Blog = tumblr.getBlogInfo(baseHostname)
  val followers: BlogFollowers = tumblr.getBlogFollowers(baseHostname, limit = 20, offset = 60)
  val post: Post = tumblr.getBlogPost(37192020774L, baseHostname)
  val posts: Seq[Post] = tumblr.getDraftPosts(baseHostname)

  val user: User = tumblr.getUserInfo() // user == the authenticated OAuth user (not some public blog)
  val dashboard: Seq[Post] = tumblr.getUserDashboard(postType = QuotePostType, includeNotesInfo = true)
  // ...
} catch {
  case TumblrApiOAuthException() => // tried to invoke an OAuth required method without needed credentials
  case TumblrApiException(400, message, contents, cause) => // Bad Request
  case TumblrApiException(401, message, contents, cause) => // Unauthorized
  case TumblrApiException(404, message, contents, cause) => // Not Found
  // ...
  case _ => // unknown error
}
```

### Posting

```scala
try {
  val params1 = new TextPostParams(baseHostname, "Some Title", "Some <b>body</b>", DraftPostState, ...)
  val postId: Long = tumblr.post(params1)

  // update the created post and publish:
  val params2 = new TextPostParams(baseHostname, "Other Title", "Diff body", PublishPostState)
  val updatedPostId = tumblr.editPost(postId, params2) // updatedPostId == postId
  val deletedPostId = tumblr.deletePost(postId, baseHostname)

  val photos: Seq[String] = List("/path/to/file1", "/path/to/file2")
  val photoParams = new PhotoPostParams(baseHostname, data = photos) // see known issues regarding photos
  val photoPostId = tumblr.post(photoParams)

  tumblr.follow("tumblr.mobocracy.net")
  tumblr.like(9666523557L, "ipd0veky")
  // ...
}
```

### HttpClient

The `TumblrApi` class uses the [Scala Cake Pattern](http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs/2011/12/19/cake-pattern-in-depth/) to inject HTTP functionality via the `HttpClient` trait. This is mainly so you can easily use a different library, user-agent string, introduce throttling or proxy, etc. in its implementation. It also helps with testing.

Constructing `TumblrApi` from its companion object (as shown [above](#authentication)) automatically mixes in `DispatchHttpClient`, which – as you can imagine – uses Dispatch for its implementation. If you'd like to implement your own version of `HttpClient`, simply do it like this:

```scala
import com.orrsella.tumblr4s.http.{HttpClient, HttpMethod}

trait MyHttpClient extends HttpClient {
  def makeRequest(
    method: HttpMethod,
    requestUrl: String,
    params: Map[String, String],
    files: Map[String, String]): String = sys.error("Not Implemented")

  def makeOAuthRequest(
    method: HttpMethod,
    requestUrl: String,
    params: Map[String, String],
    files: Map[String, String],
    consumerKey: String,
    consumerSecret: String,
    accessKey: String,
    accessSecret: String): String = sys.error("Not Implemented")
}

val myTumblr = new TumblrApi(apiKey) with MyHttpClient
```

## Known Issues

* The Tumblr API documentation for [posting photos](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posting) states that the `data` parameter in the `/post` request can be "One or more image files (submit multiple times to create a slide show)" and is of type "Array (URL-encoded binary contents)". However, this functionality does not seem to work, no matter which approached was tried for the multi-file upload. It seems that the first file is the only one used. Regardless, the multi-file implementation was still kept (as `Seq[String]`), so future attempts to fix this problem won't change the library's public API. For the time being, know that __only the first image file in a PhotoPostParams request will be used__. If you are able to fix this, or have an idea on how to, please let me know.
